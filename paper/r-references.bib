	abstract = {This study demonstrates that listeners use lexical knowledge in perceptual learning of speech sounds. Dutch listeners ﬁrst made lexical decisions on Dutch words and nonwords. The ﬁnal fricative of 20 critical words had been replaced by an ambiguous sound, between [f] and [s]. One group of listeners heard ambiguous [f]-ﬁnal words (e.g., [WItlo?], from witlof, chicory) and unambiguous [s]-ﬁnal words (e.g., naaldbos, pine forest). Another group heard the reverse (e.g., ambiguous [na:ldbo?], unambiguous witlof). Listeners who had heard [?] in [f]-ﬁnal words were subsequently more likely to categorize ambiguous sounds on an [f]–[s] continuum as [f] than those who heard [?] in [s]-ﬁnal words. Control conditions ruled out alternative explanations based on selective adaptation and contrast. Lexical information can thus be used to train categorization of speech. This use of lexical information diﬀers from the on-line lexical feedback embodied in interactive models of speech perception. In contrast to online feedback, lexical feedback for learning is of beneﬁt to spoken word recognition (e.g., in adapting to a newly encountered dialect).},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

Perceptual/lexical ambiguities were embedded in sentences in which contextual information subsequent to the item served to bias the interpretation of the ambiguous string. Two experiments are reported that investigated temporal constraints on perceptual/lexical ambiguity resolution. The results suggest that commitment to a single lexical hypothesis occurs within a relatively small window of time. When information relevant to selection of the contextually appropriate word is not forthcoming within six syllables, commitment to a single lexical hypothesis is delayed but proceeds without benefit from sentence context. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that in addition to temporal constraints, a short independent clause promotes early commitment to a single lexical hypothesis. The findings are discussed in terms of assumptions of current auditory word recognition models.},

Our participants heard sentences in which an ambiguous target word was followed less than or more than a second later by a word biased in favor of either the target word or another word. Overall, the effects of the contextual biases on responding, measured using phonemic restoration and phoneme identification, were almost as large after 1 second as before 1 second.

@unpublished{bicknell,
	title = {isteners can maintain and rationally update uncertainty about prior word},
	abstract = {Accurate word recognition is facilitated by context. Some relevant context, however, occurs after the word. Efficient use of such “right context” requires listeners to have maintained uncertainty about the word, thus allowing for consideration of possible alternatives when they encounter relevant right context. A classic study is widely cited as evidence that uncertainty maintenance is limited to highly ambiguous percepts and short time spans (Connine et al., 1991). A more recent study, however, using another phonological contrast (Szostak and Pitt, 2013) found support for the ambiguity claim but with longer-lasting effects. We use an ideal observer framework to derive specific predictions for human word recognition expected if listeners maintain and integrate uncertainty optimally with right context: the evidence provided by acoustic information and the evidence provided by (right) context should be additive in log-odds. We test these predictions both against data from previous work and two new experiments. The results are inconsistent with a model in which uncertainty is maintained primarily for highly ambiguous tokens. Instead, the results are consistent with the log-odds additivity prediction of the ideal observer. In investigating the limits of perceptual uncertainty maintenance, ideal observers provide an important, theoretically motivated, baseline against which human behavior can be interpreted.},
