This is the repository for my final project for DS4L. 

How to use:

1. Run the models file to get saved .rds files of the Bayesian models.
2. Run the code to knit the document if you'd like
3. That's it! Thanks for a great semester everyone:)

Notes:
- The 'tidy_code.R' is the file that tidied and saved all the data, you don't need to run it because the csvs are already saved
- The 'models.R' is the file that has the Bayesian models in it
- The 'code.R' is the file that has the rest of the code that I used for my analysis in it and the visualizations, etc
- The 'final_paper.Rmd' is the file that has the actual paper in it and pulls in the 'code.R' file
